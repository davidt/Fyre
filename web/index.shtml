		<p>Hot on the heels of 0.8 comes 0.9. Most notably this release includes GUI improvements, automatic cluster
		discovery, and bug fixes. We're also producing Windows binaries once again, now that the build system makes
		that much easier. Fyre 0.9 is available as:
		<ul>
		<li><a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-0.9.tar.gz">Source Code (.tar.gz)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-0.9.tar.bz2">Source Code (.tar.bz2)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-0.9.exe">Windows Installer (recommended)</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-0.9.zip">Windows .zip file, doesn't require installation</a></li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you haven't seen Fyre's animation capabilities in action yet, here's your chance. The first entry in an online
		video gallery is online. <em>Spiraling Shape</em> is a simple but elegant transition between spirals. Grab the
		<a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/media/fyre/spiraling-shape-low.avi">Low Quality AVI</a> (891 KB, 0:34) or the
		<a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/media/fyre/spiraling-shape-high.avi">High Quality AVI</a>. (12 MB, 0:34) If you
		want to open it in Fyre's animation editor, grab the <a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/media/fyre/spiraling-shape.fa.gz">gzipped .fa file</a>
		(82 KB) and feel free to experiment.
		</p>
		<p>Remember that Fyre's animation renderer writes uncompressed AVI files. You'll need a tool like
		<a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/DOCS/HTML/en/mencoder.html">mencoder</a> to compress them with your favorite codec, since
		the original files are huge and not widely supported.
		</p>

	        <div class="heading">27 January 2005 - 0.8 released</div>
		<p>This release fixes all of the known non-windows bugs. Get it now from <a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/">FlapJack</a>.</p>

		<div class="heading">02 January 2005 - 0.7 released</div>
		<p>Well, it's real soon now. All these new features are now available in <a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-0.7.tar.bz2">Fyre 0.7</a>. Windows builds at 11...</p>

		<div class="heading">12 December 2004 - Gallery updated, new release soon</div>
		<p>The image gallery has been updated, and we have a separate gallery now for screenshots. There are lots of cool new features in the <a href="http://navi.cx/svn/misc/trunk/fyre">Subversion repository</a> that should find their way into a release quite soon now: cluster support, UI improvements, OpenEXR exporting, and more.</p>

		<div class="heading">05 August 2004 - Fyre released for Windows</div>
		<p>In preparation for our trip to SIGGRAPH to show off Fyre, I figured it could be useful to be able to run Fyre under windows. So, thanks to the spiffy portability of Gtk and all the other libraries Fyre is based on, this went pretty quickly. If you haven't been able to try Fyre yet due to lack of Linux, now's your chance to <a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre/fyre-win32-20040805.exe">grab the installer and give it a try</a>.</p>

		<div class="heading">11 July 2004 - 0.6 released</div>
		<p>First release under the new name, with a slew of new features. Get it now at your friendly neighborhood <a href="http://flapjack.navi.cx/releases/fyre">releases</a> directory.</p>

		<div class="heading">09 March 2004 - New name</div>
		<p>Previously known as the "de Jong Explorer", Fyre is now named Fyre. Why the name 'Fyre'? Because it wasn't taken yet.</p>
