- It would be nice to have support for minimizing to the windows
  systray when in console mode. This combined with a way to run
  a rendering server on startup would make it easier to keep windows
  machines permanently in a cluster.

- Extend the 'interactivity preferences' dialog into a more generic
  preferences thingydoo. It would be good to change, for example,
  the number of history items we record.

- Display information on current frame progress (done/total) in the
  animation render window.
